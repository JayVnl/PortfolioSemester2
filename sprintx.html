                <p>
                    For my Sprint X project i am developing an app that let's users share pictures with each other and are able to like or comment on them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The language that i use for this project is Dart and i will be using Flutter which is a UI toolkit developed by google that allows you to programm in one language and then compile it to native code for android and ios devices.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have been interested in developing apps for quite some time and have some experience in this while using android studio and xamarin. This will be the first time i am using Dart and Flutter but i am eager to learn this since i think this will be very useful for later if i want to fully focus my career on developing apps.

                <p class="smaller-hr">
                    I started off by designing the look of the app and all the pages it should contain. I have asked my peers to give me feedback on each design and changed the design on some if i found it useful.
                </p>

                <img class="img-prisma1" src="images/sx_colours.png">
                <p class="smaller-hr">
                    Once happy with the designs in the previous step i wanted to make a colour palette that i would use throughout the entire app.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I wanted to use colours that stick out from each other and looked nice together.
                    <br>
                    The first colour palette was my first iteration which was okay but got the feedback that the middle colour looked a bit too much pink so i changed it into a more prominent red.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Coincidentally the colour palette of the app is resembling the colours of my portfolio but that's fine because i really like the combination and so did most peers.
                </p>

                <img class="img-prisma1" src="images/sx_logo_final.png">
                <p style="margin-top: -10%;" class="smaller-hr">
                    I didn't have any great idea for a name for my app but i wanted something simple and easy said so i just thought of some random words and YASS was the word i thought sounded best.
                    <br>
                    After some time i also created a definition for it which is "<u>Y</u>our <u>A</u>pplication to <u>S</u>hare <u>S</u>tories".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Going on, the logo of the app needed to be a font that fitted the background i made for the app, this background containing a lot of diamond shapes was something i wanted to be something repetitive, especially in presentations to get a reaction of "Hey a diamond shape, that reminds me of YASS".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first font i chose is the image on the left which i liked but didn't really fit. I also got the feedback that it looked like<br> Y ASS since the spacing wasn't right.
                    <br>
                    The image on the right is my next iteration which fits a lot better and will be the logo that is going to be used.

                    <p>
                        I have created the entire design in Affinity Designer. I started off by remaking the designs i made in the sketch in the programm after this i added colour to it by using my colour palette.
                        <br>
                        I work a lot with designing programms so this didn't take me too long and i think the result is pretty good.

                <div class="box-adobeXD">
                    <p>
                        As you can see i have made a prototype with Adobe XD of my app
                        <br>
                        while using the designs i made.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I think this gif shows quite clearly how the app is going to look
                        <br>
                        and work.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is the first time i have used Adobe XD and i think i did a
                        <br>
                        pretty okay job.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I will definitely use Adobe XD for more projects since it's a really
                        <br>
                        easy and solid way to present a clear picture to a client.

                    These pages are all made by me to show a kind of presentation about my app.
                    <br>
                    I wanted to show the information and features of my app in a visually pleasing way and thought that a presentation was the way to go.
                    <br>
                    I also wanted to make a sort of advertisement that could be used for my app which is the last page.

                    <br>
                    I am learning a lot experience from everything i have made so far especially developing an app which i can take with me when i am following the specialization Smart Mobile.

                    <br>
                    So far i am still working on building the app and figuring out how everyone works.
