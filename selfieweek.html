                <p>
                    For my Selfie Week project i wasn't entirely sure what to make in a week time, the one thing i did want in my project was something that wouldn't necessery be all to useful but give me more experience and learn me more of something i don't do too often but want to.
                    <br>
                    So i wanted to do something with video editing but also wanted to use different techniques that i learned in the past weeks / months.
                    <br>
                </p>
                
                <hr class="normal-hr larger-hr">
                
                <h6 class="interview-header">Storyboard</h6>
                <img class="img-failstack-ps" src="images/sw_storyboard.jpg">
                <p class="smaller-hr">
                    I started off by making a sort of storyboard / guide that would make it more clear to me how i wanted to approach my project and what i wanted to put into it.
                    <br>
                    I wanted to use a special effect as a theme and chose Neon for this as you will see at the end result. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The whole idea was to make different scenarios defining who i am hence the name Selfie Week as well. 
                    <br>
                    So the first row of images is about me playing football where i wanted to try and make it look like i was juggling with the ball and at the end shoot it into the screen for a transition into the next scene.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately i had to scrap this idea since i didn't have enough time to get the design and renders done on time, all the other scenes did make it into the final result.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The second row of images is about me teaching since i like to help other people with coding, programming or designing.
                    <br>
                    This scene has been fully designed and edited into Neon in after effects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The third row is basically how i wanted to animate a logo that i also made during the Selfie Week, more on this in the next section.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And the last row is just an ending screen also made into neon with animations.
                </p>

                <h6 class="interview-header">Logo Design</h6>
                <img class="img-failstack-ps" src="images/sw_logo_iterations.jpg">
                <p class="smaller-hr">
                    I had a general idea of a logo i wanted to make for myself a few weeks before the actual Selfie Week, funny enough i got the idea while being in the shower drawing on the glass.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When the Selfie Week started i began drawing the logo i had in my head and make different iterations from it with little changes in each.                
                </p>
                <img class="img-failstack-ps" src="images/sw_logo_chosen.jpg">
                <p class="smaller-hr">
                    Eventually i chose one of the iterations i made as the one my peers and me looked best and create it digitally through Affinity Designer (same sort of programm as Adobe Illustrator but in my opinion better).
                </p>
                <img style="margin-top: -9%;" class="img-prisma1" src="images/sw_logo.png">
                <img class="img-prisma1" src="images/sw_logo_gif.gif">
                <p>This is the end result of my logo and i am happy with how it turned out.</p>

                <h6 class="interview-header">Video</h6>
                <video class="smaller-hr" width="1280" height="720" controls>
                    <source src="images/sw_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
                <p class="smaller-hr">
                    This video is my end result of the Selfie Week and it combines all things i made above.
                    <br>
                    I am very happy with how it turned out, especially the logo and the neon animation of me teaching, i would have liked if i was able to also put in the football animation as i designed in my storyboard but i underestimated the time it would take me to make the rest and i rather have a good few products with scrapping some other ones then having everything but not all up too my standard.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From this project i have learned that it is okay to scrap certain parts as long as i can make the rest as i wanted.
                    <br>
                    I have gained more experience in video editing through after effects and also logo designing which i really enjoyed.
