                        My next project is called Swiss Toolbox, it's another chrome extension that is as it's name says a toolbox. Which basically means it has different types of tools once you open it.<br><br>
                        I started off by thinking of what kind of tools i would like to have inside the toolbox and i instantly thought it would be kinda cool to make a chrome extension that is actually useful and i could use myself as well.<br>
                        <br>
                        The first tool i thought of was a colourpicker which let's me easily pick colours that i like and puts the hex code of it into a textfield for me to copy.<br>
                        The next item on my list was to try and implement my previous project (The EZ-Dice), i wanted to see if i would be able to add an already existing programm/chrome extension into my toolbox and it did work quite nicely.<br>
                        For the next tool i asked some of my group members and my teacher and got the suggestion to add a tool that let's the user click on any image on  any website and then make it fullscreen. This was quite a challenge and i didn't get it working myself but i did get it working with the help of someone else's code. I didn't want to just copy/paste the code without knowing what it means so i went through it several times to see in what order it works and understand how it works now.<br><br>
                        From making this chrome extension i have learned that i can make every chrome extension i want and even add multiple chrome extensions into one, what makes it quite interesting for me and will make me definitely go back to this sometime to just experiment further.
